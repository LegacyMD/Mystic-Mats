# MysticMats

## Overview

Mystic Mats uses public json API for Guild Wars 2 to help user decide, whether it's more profitable to buy/sell the item or to buy/sell its components (items can be assembled from their components). 

Only few items are supported (specifically - Tier 6 fine crafting materials). Assembling yields a random quantity of desired items, so Mystic Mats provides user with least profitable, most profitable and average cases.
